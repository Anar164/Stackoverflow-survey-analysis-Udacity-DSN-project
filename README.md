# Stackoverflow-survey-analysis-Udacity-DSN-project
This project dedicated to analysis of stackoverflow survey data. Main aim of the project is to find out career satisfaction across countires, professions and undergraduate majors

Exploratory data analysis techniques were used to analyze data. I used pandas and matplotlib libraries which contains data manipulation and plotting functions. Pandas is used for aggregation (finding mean, sum by groups), filtering (removing rows with missing values and matplotlib is used for plotting histograms (to see distribution of values), scatterplots and etc.

Columns that have missing values less 20% were kept for analysis and these columns are:
