    "*I find exploratory data analysis (EDA) as powerful tool to understand data and get much useful information. Therefore, I will try apply some EDA techniques to discover stackoverflow data. I will keep columns that have missing values less than 20% and find out career satisfaction level across countries, professions and major undergraduates.*\n",
    "Our questions are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* What is distribution of career satisfaction? Is it normally distributed or it is skewed?\n",
    "* Which countries (respondents more than 300) are more satisfied as professional developers? Or in other words where it is good to be professional developer?\n",
    "* Which undergraduate majors are happier as professional developer? Are undergraduates of computer science undergraduate programms happier than undergraduates of social sciences?"
